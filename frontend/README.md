## What I've learned

### Flex

I've almost always used grid layouts when I can, and have mostly avoided flexbox. I've learned that flexbox is a lot
more powerful than I thought, and I'm excited to use it more in the future.

Some notes on flex:

- `justify-items` sets the default horizontal alignment of flex items within a flex container
- `align-items` sets the default vertical alignment of flex items within a flex container.
- `justify-content` controls the alignment and spacing of flex items along the main axis of the flex container
- `align-content` controls the alignment and spacing of flex items along the cross axis of the flex container when there
  is extra space.

### CSS Variables

I have always used preprocessor variables, but I've learned that CSS variables are quite capable and in some cases more
flexible than preprocessor variables

Example:

 ```css
/* setting */
:root {
    --primary-color: #007bff;
}

/* using */
button {
    background-color: var(--primary-color);
    color: white;
}
```

My OS doesn't play well with the browser and CSS feature `prefer-color-scheme`, so I found that setting document
variables and conditionally setting the CSS variables based on the document variables was a good solution.

```js
document.documentElement.setAttribute("theme", "dark");
```

```css
:root[theme="dark"] {
    --color-background: var(--vt-c-black);
    --color-background-soft: var(--vt-c-black-soft);
    --color-background-mute: var(--vt-c-black-mute);
}
```

### Best place to maintain state

I ran into a few issues managing state. My first instinct was to pass in props then modify those states from within the
components. It turns out that Vue props are (mostly) readonly to prevent recursive updates, making it so I had to pass
updates via emits back up to the parent.
